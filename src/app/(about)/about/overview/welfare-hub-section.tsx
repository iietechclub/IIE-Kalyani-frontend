            The foundation of this noble initiative was laid by Shri Partha
            Sarathi Hesh and Dr. Raghupati Goswami, two visionary leaders whose
            unwavering determination and deep sense of purpose propelled the
            dream forward. Recognizing the transformative power of education,
            they aspired to create an institution that would serve as a beacon
            of knowledge and progress.

            Their mission was further strengthened by the invaluable support of
            Mr. Bratish Kumar Sarkar, an accomplished entrepreneur whose
            distinguished career has been defined by integrity, innovation, and
            social responsibility. Inspired by the cause, he extended his
            collaboration, bringing his expertise and unwavering dedication to
            help translate this vision into reality.
